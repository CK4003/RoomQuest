RoomQuest is an android mobil application that lets users navigate to destinations on the California State University, San Bernardino Main campus. It is
still currently being developed and tested. When complete, RoomQuest will allow the students, visitors, faculty and staff of California State University, San Bernardino find their
way around the University. It uses the ArcGIS geographic information system, ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android and ArcGIS Enterprise server. It finds rooms, professors, and other campus destinations like officers and student resources.


 To run: In order to run and test the application, the app has to be connected to CSUSB's VPN because the information contained in it is stored in server within the school.


NOTE: if ran without a CSUSB VPN connection, the app wonâ€™t display any content. It will only display a streets basemap.
